    <h1> <i><u>Motivational Speech</u> </i></h1>
    <p><i>"Every one of us has a story 📖. 
        A story filled with highs and lows, wins and losses, doubts and dreams 🌟. 
        And too often, we wait for the perfect moment — the perfect plan, the perfect opportunity — before we begin. 
        But here's the truth: perfection is a myth ❌. Progress is what matters ✅. 
        You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great 🚀. 
        Whether you're chasing a goal, starting over, or just trying to make it through the day, remember this — the power is already inside you 💪.
         Your voice matters 🎤, your dreams matter 🌈, and most importantly, you matter ❤️. 
        So take that leap, even if you're scared. Walk through fear, not around it. 
        Because the world needs what only you can bring 🌍✨. 
        Keep going — you've got this! 🔥🙌""</i></p>
